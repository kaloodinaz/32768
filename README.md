## 🚀 About

**32768** is an extended variant of the classic **2048** game, with the objective of creating the 32768 tile.  
Unlike the usual 4×4 grid, this variant operates on a **6×6 board**, making the gameplay more strategic and longer.  
It challenges players to think ahead, manage space, and plan merges carefully.

This version is a “clone” or adaptation of the 2048 mechanics by **Kaloo Dinaz**.  
The original (unofficial) 2048 game also stems from the same author’s work.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Use your **arrow keys** (or swipe on mobile) to move the tiles in the four directions (up, down, left, right).  
2. When two tiles with the **same number** touch, they will **merge into one** (summing their values).  
3. Your goal is to keep merging until you form the **32768** tile.  
4. The larger board gives you more room—but also more complexity in managing merges and board state.

## 🎯 Why Play This Version?

- More strategic depth due to larger grid  
- More room for “breathing space” but also more challenge in planning  
- Variety of fun thematic and mechanical variants to try  
- Accessible in browser — no install needed
